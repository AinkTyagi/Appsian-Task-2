## 🎯 How to Use These Files

### 1. First-Time Deployment

Start here:
```bash
# Read the getting started guide
cat GETTING_STARTED_WITH_DEPLOYMENT.md

# Then follow the quick deploy guide
cat QUICK_DEPLOY.md

# Use checklist to track progress
# Open DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md in your editor
```

### 2. Setting Up CI/CD

After basic deployment:
```bash
# Read CI/CD setup instructions
cat .github/README.md

# GitHub will automatically use these files:
# - .github/workflows/deploy.yml
# - .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### 3. Using Make Commands

Quick operations:
```bash
# See all available commands
make help

# Common workflows
make dev              # Start development
make test             # Run tests
make deploy-check     # Verify ready to deploy
make docker-up        # Test with Docker
```

### 4. Docker Testing

Test production setup locally:
```bash
# Start containers
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop containers
docker-compose down
```

### 5. Troubleshooting

When issues occur:
```bash
# Read troubleshooting sections in:
cat DEPLOYMENT.md              # General issues
cat DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md      # Quick fixes
cat .github/README.md          # CI/CD issues
```
